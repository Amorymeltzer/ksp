Version 0.95.1 - 2015-04-11
-------------------------
SCANsat gives half science data for Jool and Kerbol scans
Add VABSouthComplex minibiome in KSC
 - Previously undocumented but appears to exist only in stage 2
Add -e/excludeexcel option to skip forming the .xlsx file
The -o option now fails without -a or -t and gently notifies the user
Rename -o option (outputavgtable instead of outputdatatable)
The -i option now uses only lowercase (includescansat instead of includeSCANsat)
Formatted help to be more helpful

Version 0.95 - 2015-04-08
-------------------------

Add -g gamelocation to specify where your KSP folder is
 - Incorporate defaults by operating system (Mac, Linux, Win)
  -- Probably still a WIP
You can, indeed, do SCANsat on the Sun and Jool
 - Known issue: Cap appears to be off for these by 1/2
No SCANsat for KSC
Fix major issue where -aM would fail do to incorrect number in average calculations and double-splicing of boring data

Version 0.94.3 - 2015-04-05
-------------------------

Now defaults to leaving out dev-data (sbv, dsc, scv)
 - Add -m moredata flag to reinsert them
Add -o outputdatatable to save results from -a or -t to a file (average_table.txt)
 - Update deltaVScience.pl to use correct file
Add boundaries.pl
 - New script that simply prints out InSpaceHigh, FlyingHigh, etc. cutoffs
 
Version 0.94 - 2015-04-01
-------------------------

Fully incorporate KSC biomes into analysis
 - Use -k flag to fold data under Kerbin instead of KSC
Change dotfile flag to -f (was -k)

Version 0.93.1 - 2015-03-25
-------------------------

Remove -H option to show help
 - Confusing given the use of uppercased flags to negate options, and redundant given -h.
